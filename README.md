GOAL STACK PLANNER

Linear:
Cube world operations
Handler to use operations
Start state and goal conditions
Work backwards to find out operations to achieve goals one by one
 
Non Linear:
Check step ahead if need to undo suggested operation to achieve any other goal
If so check to see if can achieve that goal without doing suggested operation, if so abandon suggested operation.
